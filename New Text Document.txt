    Data Preprocessing:
        Load the FER2013 Dataset: Download the dataset and split it into train, test, and validation sets.
        Resizing and Normalization: Resize all images to a consistent size (e.g., 48x48 pixels) and normalize them by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the pixel values.

    Feature Extraction:
        Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG): Extract HOG features from the preprocessed images. HOG captures the distribution of intensity gradients in the image, providing information about the edges and shapes in the face.
        Local Binary Patterns (LBP): Extract LBP features from the images. LBP encodes the local texture patterns by comparing each pixel with its neighbors and creating a binary code.

    Emotion Classification:
        Support Vector Machine (SVM): Train an SVM classifier using the extracted features. SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that can handle high-dimensional data and is well-suited for FER tasks.

    Model Training:
        Training Data Preparation: Split the training set into smaller batches to feed into the model during training.
        Training the SVM Classifier: Train the SVM classifier on the training batches using a suitable loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam optimizer).

    Model Evaluation:
        Accuracy: Calculate the accuracy of the model on the test set by comparing the predicted emotions with the ground truth labels.
        Confusion Matrix: Generate a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model for each emotion class.

    Model Deployment:
        Web App: Deploy the trained model as a web app that allows users to upload images and receive emotion predictions in real-time.
        Mobile App: Develop a mobile app that integrates the model for on-device emotion recognition using the device's camera.
